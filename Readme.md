# howto.cpp
Trying to remind myself what C++ is all about.

## Build
Before build there is a need to create `bin` directory - I'll resolve that later.

## Visual Studio Code
* to build the project press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `B` and select `build` task.
* to build and run press `f5`.

## Notes
* You could use `locate` to search for liblaries in system. ex: `locate iostream`.
