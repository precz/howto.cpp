# howto.cpp
Trying to remind myself what C++ is all about.

## Visual Studio Code
* to build the project press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `B` and select `Build` task.
* to build and run press `f5`.

1. Install `boots_test` module - [Boost Libraries](http://www.boost.org/).
   For fedora `sudo dnf install boost-test boost-devel`.
1. Run tests by pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `B` and selecting `RunTests` task.

## Notes
* You could use `locate` to search for liblaries in system. ex: `locate iostream`.
